* The **mkdir** command is used to create new directories

**A directory**, referred to as a folder in some operating systems, appears to the user as a container for other directories and files. Unix-like operating systems treating directories as _a special type of file that contains a list of filenames and their corresponding inode numbers_. Each inode number refers to an inode, which is located in inode tables (which are kept at strategic locations around the filesystem) and which contains all information about a file (i.e. file, permissions and date of creation) except its name and the actual data that the file contains.

**An inode** is a data structure on a filefyftem on Linux and other Unix-like operating systems that stores all information about a file except its name and its actual data.

**A data structure**  is a way of storing data so that it can be used efficiently.

**A filesystem** is the hierarchy of directories that is used to orginise file on a computer. On Unix-like operating systems, the directories start with the _root directory_, which contains a series of subdirectories, each of which, in turn, may contain further subdirectories, etc.

**A file** is a named collection of related information that appears to the user as a single, contiguos block of data and that is retained in storage. It does not automaticcaly contain information about itself, unless some human purposly adds in such data. Such information _about_ a file, in contrast to the data contained _in_ a file, is its **metadata**. [Source](http://www.linfo.org/inode.html)


* The **print** statement evaluates each expression in turn and writes the resulting object to standard output.
If an object is not a string, it is first converted to a string using the rules for string conversions. The (resulting or original) string is then written. A space is written before each object is written, unless the output system belives it is positioned at the beginning of a line. This is the case
  1. when no characters have yet been written to standard output,
  2. when the last character written to standard output is a whitespace character except "' '", or
  3. when the last write operation on standard output was not a "print" statement.

* **Standard output** is defined as the file object named _stdout_ in the build-in module _sys_. 
If no such object exists, or if it does not have a _"write()"_ method, a _"RuntimeError"_ exception is raised. [Source](https://docs.python.org/2/reference/simple_stmts.html#print)


* Comments in Python start with the **hash character*, **_#_**, and extend to the end of the physical line. A comment may appear at the start of a line or following whitespace or code, but not within a string literal. A hash character within a string literal is just a hash character.
