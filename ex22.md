The **mkdir** command is used to create new directories

**A directory**, referred to as a folder in some operating systems, appears to the user as a container for other directories and files. Unix-like operating systems treating directories as _a special type of file that contains a list of filenames and their corresponding inode numbers_. Each inode number refers to an inode, which is located in inode tables (which are kept at strategic locations around the filesystem) and which contains all information about a file (i.e. file, permissions and date of creation) except its name and the actual data that the file contains.

**An inode** is a data structure on a filefyftem on Linux and other Unix-like operating systems that stores all information about a file except its name and its actual data.

**A data structure**  is a way of storing data so that it can be used efficiently.

**A filesystem*** is the hierarchy of directories that is used to orginise file on a computer. On Unix-like operating systems, the directories start with the _root directory_, which contains a series of subdirectories, each of which, in turn, may contain further subdirectories, etc.

**A file** is a named collection of related information that appears to the user as a single, contiguos block of data and that is retained in storage. It does not automaticcaly contain information about itself, unless some human purposly adds in such data. Such information _about_ a file, in contrast to the data contained _in_ a file, is its **metadata**.
